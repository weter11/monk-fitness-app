/**
 * Architecture v2 — the ordered engine orchestrator (RFC_ENGINE_PIPELINE §3/§5, Gap 1).
 *
 * **M2 scope (this file):** `PIPELINE_ACTIVE` now defaults to **true** and `produceFrame` drives
 * the full ordered stage chain for every consumer:
 *
 * ```
 * Pose.build() → ConstraintSolver.solve (contacts only) → SkeletonPoseFinalizer.finalize (FK + flatten) → optional Validator
 * ```
 *
 * The Finalizer's internal `ConstraintSolver.solve` call was removed in M2 (RFC_ENGINE_PIPELINE
 * §8.1) — the pipeline is now the **sole** caller of both the Solver and the Finalizer, in fixed
 * order, which eliminates the latent re-entrancy (Finalizer→Solver→Finalizer) that existed before.
 * This is a **re-pointing** change: the Solver+Finalizer code paths are byte-identical to the
 * pre-M2 baseline (Solver still no-ops on contact-less poses; the Finalizer performs exactly the
 * same work it did when it called the Solver itself), so the rendered frame is unchanged.
 *
 * **Legacy bypass:** with [EngineFlags.PIPELINE_ACTIVE] `false`, `produceFrame` falls back to the
 * pre-M0 flow (`pose.build()` → `finalizer.finalize()` with *no* pipeline-owned Solver call) so the
 * old path remains reachable for rollback and the M0 byte-identity guarantee still holds.
 *
 * **Ownership & lifetime (RFC_ENGINE_PIPELINE §Issue 5):** a `SkeletonPipeline` owns its stage
 * *instances* (currently the [SkeletonPoseFinalizer] and an optional [ExerciseValidator]) and the
 * per-frame previous/pre-previous pose history used by the dynamics validator rules. It is a
 * long-lived, per-engine/per-definition object — **not** created per frame or per pose. It is not
 * thread-safe (one instance per render loop), matching the existing single-threaded finalizer.
